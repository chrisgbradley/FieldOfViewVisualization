# FieldOfViewVisualization
Visualize player field of view and object obstruction with internal target detection.


## Learned...
- Limit Unity inspector parameters inside custom scripts.
- Use simplified version of binary search for edge detection
- Manipulate and render mesh using code
- More vertices equal better resolution
- Trig is all fun and games until you're having to use it in real life and for some reason you forget it all of a sudden


## Would like to look into...
- Render lifecycle and how Update(), FixedUpdate(), LateUpdate(), and potentially more are used effectively in Unity
- Editor extensions vs MonoBehavior and more uses of [CustomEditor()]
- Physics.Raycast
- Deeper understanding of normals and normalized in terms of vectors
- transform.eulersAngles


## Potential Applications...
- Visualize and debug NPC AI
- Roguelike fog of war
- Controlling individual units and using their FoV
